### HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Ä°lker YÄ±lmaz

Increase your repos and support the work instead of putting cool logos here

I'm 17 years old and I'm studying at Social Sciences High School. Even though I'm a social scientist, software and computers are my life.

I am currently learning data science and want to work on cloud in the future

My other goal is; to be able to use social sciences actively in integration with software. I want to work with fields such as energy economics

I think of energy economy because there is climate change in the future and it will affect us all.
