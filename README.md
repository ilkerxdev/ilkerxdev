### HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Ä°lker YÄ±lmaz

Increase your repos and support the work instead of putting cool logos here

I'm 17 years old and I'm studying at Social Sciences High School. Even though I'm a social scientist, software and computers are my life.

I am currently learning python and want to work on cloud in the future

My other goal is; to be able to use social sciences actively in integration with software. I want to work with fields such as economics, psychology, etc.

I care about the development of human sciences and I think the need is in this regard.
